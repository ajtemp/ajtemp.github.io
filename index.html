  <h1 class="text-center">1. Quality/Viewership of The Simpsons, Episode by Episode</h1>
  <h5 class="text-center">by Andrew Johnson, anryjohn@ucsc.edu</h5>
  <hr>
  <p>This project's purpose is to make easily apparent to the viewer which seasons of The Simpsons are worth watching. The Simpsons have had a well-documented dip in quality ever since around season 9 and that may raise questions about which Simpsons episodes in which season are worth your time. Additionally, this project will compare reviews and ratings of each episode, to see if there is any correlation between the quality of any given episode and the viewership of said episode. While there are some charts that exist with similar themes, I intend to develop this available information into a visually dynamic graphic.</p>

  <h1 class="text-center">2. Aggregation of types of Drug-Related Crimes in San Francisco</h1>
  <h5 class="text-center">by Andrew Johnson, anryjohn@ucsc.edu</h5>
  
  <p>This project's purpose is to express the types of drug-related crimes in SF and how they vary in nature and severity. It's also designed to illustrate how frequently crimes occur and how they are typically responded to. I intend to display this in such a way that it aggregates types of crime into a single container, and then compares it with other types of crime.</p>
